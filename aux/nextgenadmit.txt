How to Use the Common Data Set to Build Your College List

   You've picked out a few colleges that seem perfect, but how do you
   really know if they're the right fit? Comparing them can feel
   overwhelming until you discover the common data set. The Common Data
   Set (CDS) is a powerful tool that can simplify your college search and
   help you make informed decisions. In this article, we'll explore what
   the Common Data Set is, how colleges use it, and most importantly, how
   you can leverage it to your advantage.

What Is the Common Data Set?

   The Common Data Set is a document containing valuable statistics and
   information on nearly every 4-year college and university in the US.
   Created annually by the College Board in collaboration with higher
   education associations, the CDS covers various aspects of each
   institution, including admissions, financial aid, student demographics,
   and academic offerings. Its purpose is to provide transparency and
   standardization in college data, making it easier for students to
   compare and evaluate different institutions.

What do colleges cover in the Common Data Set?

   Each college's Common Data Set is a comprehensive document of 30+
   pages, organized into sections such as general information, enrollment
   and persistence, admission requirements, financial aid options, student
   life, and more. This wealth of information can help you gain insights
   into factors such as average test scores, acceptance rates, financial
   aid availability, and student demographics, allowing you to make
   well-informed decisions about which colleges are the best fit for you.

   The CDS aims to provide transparent and comparable information for
   prospective students. While not always perfect, it can serve as a
   helpful resource in your college search and application process. Be
   sure to look at the CDS for any schools you're seriously interested in
   to make the most informed choice.

What if I have more questions about a school's admissions process?

   Feel free to reach out to the school directly with any specific
   questions about their admissions process. However, it's advisable to
   conduct your own research beforehand, as it's not ideal to ask
   questions that are readily available online. Keep in mind that college
   admissions counselors are busy individuals and prefer not to be
   contacted unless you have a specific question that you cannot find the
   answer to online.

Conclusion

   The Common Data Set is an invaluable resource for researching and
   comparing colleges. By understanding the data and what it represents,
   you'll be in a much better position to find schools that are the best
   fit for your needs and priorities. Best of luck!
